Client Component

The Client will be used for 2 purposes.

1. Communicate with the Server to request variables and receive values
2. Update the cockpit display to reflect the changed variable values

The client should connect to the server component.

The main window should allow the user to choose how they want the Client to display the cockpit layout. This will include options like:

1. Turn cockpit on/off
2. Display the cockpit as either a window or chromeless fullscreen
	a. In windowed mode, allow the user to select the size and position of the cockpit
	b. In fullscreen mode, allow the user to select the screen or screens to use for the cockpit
3. Automatically select the correct layout for the aircraft being flown
	a. Change the display each time a different aircraft is used, or
	b. Permit the user to override this and choose their own layout to display

In the cockpit display, the selected layout should simply identify which instrument types are required, their relative position within the cockpit layout, and the relative size of each.

The instruments themselves should be designed as custom instruments (plugins) or user-defined instruments, to provide an object that will be placed in the correct position and size within the cockpit layout.

If there are no custom instruments for a given layout, the cockpit should use a suitable generic plugin, to act as a fall-back option.

If there is no generic plugin, the cockpit should ignore that part of the layout and display nothing.
